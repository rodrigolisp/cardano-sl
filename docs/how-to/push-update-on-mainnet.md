Overview
========

Software update is a protocol mechanism that allows nodes to agree on software changes without altering protocol constants and update to this software version.
1. Software update is proposed. Proposal is a datatype that gets into
   the blockchain. It contains information about version changes and
   hashes of update files.
2. Update files are uploaded to the S3 bucket.
3. Software update is confirmed by voting from majority of nodes.
4. Nodes that see an update try to download and apply it
   automatically.

Now, again, step-by-step.

Prerequisites
=============
1. Cluster nodes' keys. They are crucial to have since cluster nodes
   are the only nodes that have stake in the system so they are the
   only nodes that can propose an update and vote for it.
2. Access to the S3 bucket
3. Installers corresponding to software version we're pushing to cluster
   - Those are two executables (exe for win, pkg for mac) which are to be provided by QA (after QA procedures passed)
   - Advice: after providing installers, ask QA to confirm hashes are same, we don't want to ship users incorrect installers to users
4. Software version
   - Single integer, denote application version as for installers provided

Proposing the update
====================

Ensure your keys are somewhere around and named, say, `nodeX.key`,
where `X âˆˆ [1..7]`. Procedure is done using `cardano-auxx`
executable, branch's code should be compatible with cluster (take release branch, e.g. `cardano-sl-1.0`).

You should change param `--peer` for all commands listed below (it is a host of any relay node). Also consider changing `--log-config`, `--logs-prefix`.
Note `--system-start 0` is perfectly valid because we don't need actual value for `cardano-auxx`.

Import secret keys: only 4 of 7 is needed. Cluster nodes all have equal stake and more than a half stake's votes is needed to make a decision about update (approve/dismiss). Imported keys are stored locally (in `secret.key` which you can delete later).

```
stack exec cardano-auxx -- --system-start 0 --log-config
  scripts/log-templates/log-config-qa.yaml
  --logs-prefix "logs/auxx-update-1.0.1" --db-path auxx-update-1.0.1
  --peer <relay dns name>:3000 cmd --commands "add-key node1.key, add-key node2.key, add-key node3.key, add-key node4.key, listaddr"
```

Propose an update:

```
stack exec cardano-auxx -- --system-start 0 --log-config
  scripts/log-templates/log-config-qa.yaml
  --logs-prefix "logs/auxx-update-1.0.1" --db-path auxx-update-1.0.1
  --peer <relay dns name>:3000 cmd --commands "propose-update 0 0.0.0 0 20 2000000 csl-daedalus:1 win64 daedalus1.exe none macos daedalus1c.pkg none"
```

Syntax and semantics of `propose-update` command:

```
propose-update <N> <block ver> <script ver> <slot duration> <max block size> <software ver> <propose_file>?
```

* First argument is index of imported key you're sending update
from. Step "import secret keys" has `listaddr` command in the end. Check it's output -- any cluster node will
do (`0` states for first key imported).
* Parameters 2-5 are block version data parameters -- leave them as
they are provided in the cli example.
* `csl-daedalus:1` is software version description, you should substitute `1` (version) with the integer provided along with installers (see *Prerequisites* section, *4.* item)
* End of command: list of triples -- update installers. Provide the path to installers
without any slashes (installers should be in the same dir as auxx is
launched in). First tuple element is platform, second is path, `none` stands for binary diff (this feature is not used for now).

That's it. Successfull command output looks like this:

These hashes should be used as names when you will upload installers on S3 buckets.

Note: 
```
Update proposal submitted, upId: 4c827d6fe03d4c3646ebbbc28d4e09c57690e1dcba54b9adc0050d3f76734cf6
```

Value `upId` is used on one of next steps, when we'll vote for update.

Uploading update files
======================

Upload installers to S3 bucket:
* `update-system-testing` if update is being performed on staging
* `update-system` if update is being performed on live mainnet cluster

Voting for proposal
===================

```
stack exec cardano-auxx -- --system-start 0 --log-config
  scripts/log-templates/log-config-qa.yaml
  --logs-prefix "logs/auxx-update-1.0.1" --db-path auxx-update-1.0.1
  --peer <relay dns name>:3000 cmd --commands "vote 1 y 4c827d6fe03d4c3646ebbbc28d4e09c57690e1dcba54b9adc0050d3f76734cf6,vote 2 y 4c827d6fe03d4c3646ebbbc28d4e09c57690e1dcba54b9adc0050d3f76734cf6,vote 3 y 4c827d6fe03d4c3646ebbbc28d4e09c57690e1dcba54b9adc0050d3f76734cf6,vote 4 y 4c827d6fe03d4c3646ebbbc28d4e09c57690e1dcba54b9adc0050d3f76734cf6"
```

In `vote N y 4c827d6fe03d4c3646ebbbc28d4e09c57690e1dcba54b9adc0050d3f76734cf6`:

* `N` should be index of key (from `listadr`)
* `y` is for yes
* `4c827d6fe03d4c3646ebbbc28d4e09c57690e1dcba54b9adc0050d3f76734cf6` is update proposal id or `upId`

Successfull output ends in "submitted a vote". Votes will be sent to the network, software update will apply soon.
